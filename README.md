- [How to Find the Optimal K for K-Means](https://github.com/eeliuqin/machine-learning/blob/main/how-to-find-optimal-k-k-means.ipynb)<br/>
    * Content: The post shows 2 methods for finding the optimal number of clusters in K-Means, the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis.


- [Kyphosis Disease Classification](https://github.com/eeliuqin/machine-learning/blob/main/kyphosis-disease-classification.ipynb)<br/>
    * Task: Predicting whether a child will have Kyphosis after surgery, based on his/her age, the number of vertebrae involved,
    and the number of the topmost vertebra operated on.
    * Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
    * Result: The highest accuracy 76% is from Logistic Regression classifier with customized threshold.

- [Health Insurance Cost Prediction](https://github.com/eeliuqin/machine-learning/blob/main/medical-insurance-prediction.ipynb)<br/>
    * Task: Predicting health insurance cost of individuals based on their age, gender, BMI, smoking habit, number of children,
    and geolocation.
    * Models: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Neural Networks.
    * Result: The highest adjusted R^2 0.893 and lowest MSE and MAE are from Neural Networks.
